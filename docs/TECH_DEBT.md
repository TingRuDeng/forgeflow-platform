# forgeflow-platform Technical Debt

Only confirmed, still-active debt belongs here.

## 1. Dispatcher compatibility wrappers still depend on `apps/dispatcher/dist` freshness

Current situation:

- dispatcher control-plane ownership now lives in `apps/dispatcher/`
- `scripts/lib/dispatcher-server|dispatcher-state|review-memory|task-worktree|review-decision` 只保留 bootstrap / compatibility wrapper
- live entrypoints still depend on checked-in adapters importing `apps/dispatcher/dist`

Impact:

- bootstrap/freshness bugs can still appear at the boundary between source and built `dist`
- compatibility wrappers still add one extra layer for debugging local runtime startup

Desired direction:

- either keep this adapter split explicit and well-tested
- or remove more checked-in wrappers once all supported entrypoints can run directly from packaged/app-owned runtime modules

## 2. SQLite runtime state, JSON fallback, and schema constants still coexist without one fully consolidated persistence story

Current situation:

- dispatcher runtime state now defaults to SQLite via `runtime-state-sqlite.ts`
- JSON fallback still exists for explicit compatibility mode and import bootstrap
- `apps/dispatcher/src/db/schema.ts` still defines standalone SQLite schema constants that are not the active runtime persistence path

Impact:

- easy to overstate database maturity or assume every persistence path is SQLite-first
- persistence-related changes can still land in the default SQLite backend, the JSON fallback, or the schema constants separately

Desired direction:

- keep the SQLite snapshot backend and JSON fallback explicitly documented, or further consolidate the remaining duplicate persistence representations
- decide whether `apps/dispatcher/src/db/schema.ts` should survive as a compatibility constant set now that runtime SQLite + structured projection tables are the live path

## 3. Postgres / queue shadow path exists, but external stores are not primary yet

Current situation:

- dispatcher now has query-first SQLite projection tables
- optional Postgres / queue shadow write also exists
- SQLite snapshots remain the truth source

Impact:

- external drift detection and rollout discipline still matter
- it is easy to overstate stage-3 maturity as “already migrated to Postgres”

Desired direction:

- keep shadow mode / primary mode boundaries explicit
- add stronger drift reporting and eventual cutover / rollback discipline before any primary-store switch

## 4. Trae automation gateway has duplicated implementations with behavior drift

Verified drift:

- packaged runtime exposes `POST /v1/sessions/:sessionId/release`
- `scripts/lib/` gateway does not
- default session-store paths differ

Impact:

- docs can overclaim parity
- fixes land in one implementation but not the other

Desired direction:

- reduce duplication or add an explicit sync rule and shared compatibility test coverage

## 5. Stable agent-facing docs were previously concentrated in rule/nav docs but lacked a durable knowledge layer

Impact:

- agents had to infer architecture, persistence, and HTTP boundaries from scattered files
- repeated rediscovery risk was high

Current status:

- partially addressed by the docs added in this pass

Remaining need:

- keep these docs synced whenever runtime boundaries or API surfaces change

## 6. Stage 3 ecosystem wave is intentionally deferred

Current situation:

- stage-3 core platform waves are now in place
- external API / SDK / third-party admission remains intentionally postponed

Impact:

- internal platform maturity is ahead of public integration maturity
- consumers should not assume stable public API/SDK guarantees yet

Desired direction:

- keep Wave 5 explicitly out of “already supported” docs until governance and compatibility policy are finalized
